# Mobile Trigger [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/azohra/bitrise_mobile_trigger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/azohra/bitrise_mobile_trigger)

Mobile Trigger is a command line bitrise client, used to trigger workflows on [Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io). It can be used as a standalone tool for triggering jobs but primarily intended to be used in combination with continuous integration systems like Bamboo CI or [Gitlab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/features/gitlab-ci-cd/).



## Installation

Download the platform specific binary file from the release/tags page, and place the binary in the project you are building.



## Usage

```bash
Usage: bitriseTrigger [flags] [options]

-V --version  - Version of cli running.

-w --workflow-id  WORKFLOW_ID                 - Bitrise workflow id.
-b --branch       BRANCH_NAME                 - Name of the branch to be built.
-c --config       CONFIG_PATH                 - Absolute path of to configuration file.
-e --env          ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=VALUE  - List of environment variables to be passed e.g. key1=value1,key2=value2

-h --help  - Prints this help message
```

The mobile trigger application must be given a configuration file. For example:

```json
{
	"theAccessToken": "give the access token here, e.g. sdvsdfvsdvk3246823t9",
	"token": "given project api token here, e.g. ED34r3DsW33",
	"slug": "the project api slug goes here, e.g. TE78gsdsUUop22",
	"projectName": "The name of the project given here"
}
```

Use the mandatory configuration flag `-c` or `â€”config` to specify the absolute path to the configuration file. An overall example of use would be:

```shell
./bitriseTrigger -w UnitTest -b develop --config /User/name/myproject/config.json
```
